# Project1
Create a program that connects the GUI and JDBC Database
Note:
Could not get the table on the GUI to connect with my database, so the Activate/Suspend Status button will not work
Search will require you to enter the username on the console which is found in my Database.

Step 1 and 2 are for opening Oracle SQL Developer
//Note: I don't know if its neccessary
The OracleSQL Step 1 and 2 are for uploading table into Oracle SQL Developer
